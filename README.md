## Description :bulb:

Burger Eats is a Node Express application that uses MySQL as a database. Handlebars is handling the HMTL and it's a one page that demonstrates user inputs and the application rendering and displaying the information and making changes to that information. 

1. The user inputs what Burger they want to eat
2. The application takes the value and renders it and displays on the html
3. A "EATNOW" and a "Bye Burger" button is displayed next to the user Burger value
4. User selects the "EATNOW" button and the value is move to the other section which represents the burger has been consumed.
5. User select the "Bye Burger" button and the value is removed
6. The user can add as many burger as they want


## Challenges! :warning:

- Couldn't figure out to get the "EATNOW" button to work, When the value is taken and move to the other section.
