## BurgerEats




## Description :bulb:

Burger Eats is a Node Express application that uses MySQL as a database. Handlebars is handling the HMTL and it's a one page that demonstrates user inputs and the application rendering and displaying the information and making changes to that information. 

1. The user inputs what Burger they want to eat
2. The application takes the value and renders it and displays on the html
3. A "devoured" button is displayed next to the user Burger value
4. User selects the "devoured" button and the value is move to the other side which represents the burger has been consumed.
5. The user can add as many burger as they want


## Challenges! :warning:

- Couldn't figure out to get the application active in the browser

- The MVC file structure was challenging, not sure if everything is communication correctly

- My Heroku server kept failing, it kept prompting the password optin. 

- Still confused on the ORM functionality and some of the json requests



## Conslusion :boom:

Very challenging assignment, did my best.
